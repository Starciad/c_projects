# Battle

A turn-based RPG game for terminals.

## Overview

Battle is a simple turn-based RPG game developed in C, designed to run in terminal environments. This project is a micro-experience whose core is based solely and exclusively on battles that become progressively more challenging. You have a basic set of actions (attack, defend and inventory) and must win battles with what you have.

At the end of each battle you will be rewarded with items and improvements, allowing you to build personalized builds and add an extra layer of depth to the game.

The game is infinitely playable, with a simple but engaging combat system, and is a great way to practice C programming and terminal-based game development.
